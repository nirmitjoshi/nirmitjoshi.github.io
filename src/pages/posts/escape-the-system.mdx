we built a cage disguised as progress. creativity is suffocated by forms, frameworks, and checklists. compliance is king. thinking is obsolete. you don’t ask questions, you beg for permission. you don’t solve problems—you wait for a stamp of approval. the system feeds on obedience, not ideas.

## trained to obey, not think

you stopped asking “why?” now you whisper “can i?”. thought is replaced by bureaucracy. you follow rules, submit templates, and clap when the system demands. you’re a cog, trained to repeat, not rebel.

## productivity illusion

reading isn’t learning — it’s performance art. you waste hours formatting notes in notion, mistaking color-coded lists for knowledge. then comes jobs which aren’t about skills, they’re about collecting coursera badges and begging HR for roles who isn't even a real validator. you’re not building. you’re curating a lie.<br/><br/>

education is worse. memorize. regurgitate. repeat. attendance matters more than curiosity. solve real problems? no, that’d be too risky. can’t have independent minds roaming around. _schools make hoop-jumpers, not thinkers._

## corporate circus

busywork translates as progress. ten-step workflows for two-step tasks. meetings about meetings. reports no one reads. you don’t fix problems, you prove you followed the process. burnout is the trophy. the system survives. you don’t.

## tech’s empty hype

_tech sold dreams, now it sells buzzwords_. “empowering humanity through innovation”, “we make the world a better place” empty slogans for billion-dollar valuations. and real innovation? hmmm. no one’s inventing. everyone’s pretending.

## break or be broken

if you play by these rules, you lose. the system wins when you trade curiosity for checklists. tear up the permission slips. ask “why” again. build your own path. _rebels survive. obedient minds rust_.
